# ðŸ”§ Installing the plugin

Now that you have downloaded the plugin to your computer, you need to install it in your server(s). This is a folder containing a Purpur 1.19 server, but it is very similar to a Spigot or Paper server:

![Main directory of a Purpur 1.19 server](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)

Now, navigate into the /plugins directory, and drop in the zAngelTags-x.x.jar into the folder. If you don't have PlaceholderAPI installed yet, this is the moment. Repeat the same download process with PlaceholderAPI from SpigotMC clicking here. Then, drop the PlaceholderAPI-x.x.x.jar into the same directory as the zAngelTags. Now, you can start the server to generate the plugin configurations.&#x20;

If you see this message, the plugin has loaded correctly. As you can see, by default, the database has been set to SQLite. You have finished installing zAngelTags. Click on the button below to continue with the plugin configuration.
